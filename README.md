# Cakely Vault and Runner Setup
> Vault and self hosted runner setup for cakely/api-ops and cakely/api

## About

Though GitHub Actions comes with an encrypted [secret store](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets), some users will prefer to keep secrets in [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/), either out of feature set comparison or convenience in already having secrets stored in Vault.

This repository provides instructions for replacing the Actions secret store with Vault by utilizing network-connected self-hosted runners. It contains Vault policies and AWS IAM policies for an "EKS / ECR Admin" self hosted runner (more privileged) and an "ECR Push" self hosted runner (less privileged).

## Context

This repo is the technical complement to a webinar entitled Secure GitOps Workflows with GitHub Actions and HashiCorp Vault, delivered on August 25<sup>th</sup> 2020, which can be viewed online [**here**](https://www.hashicorp.com/resources/secure-gitops-workflows-with-github-actions-and-hashicorp-vault).

The work here represents the final state of the demos and workflows that were presented as a part of that webinar. It is recommended to view this repo in the context of that webinar.

For more goodness related to cake, GitHub, and Terraform, kindly view the previous webinar entitled [Unlocking the Cloud Operating Model with GitHub Actions](https://www.hashicorp.com/resources/unlocking-the-cloud-operating-model-with-github-actions/).

## Pre-requisites

- AWS account
- New IAM user with [`superuser-iam-policy.json`](superuser-iam-policy.json) attached. Make note of the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.

## Setup

#### Start Vault and set up AppRole auth method

<details><summary>Instructions</summary>

```bash
# Start up vault dev server if not already started
# Note: vault server -dev NOT recommended production
vault server -dev
export VAULT_ADDR='http://127.0.0.1:8200'

# Enable AppRole auth method
vault auth enable approle
```

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Self Hosted Runner "EKS / ECR Admin" (More Privileged)

![admin](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2993937/90151776-199e8800-dd55-11ea-9842-a6e6c67bde8b.png)

<details><summary>Instructions</summary>

```bash
############### EKS / ECR Admin ####################

# Generate a Personal Access Token with repo scope for eksctl deploy key, add it to Vaults
vault kv put secret/github/eksctlDeployKey pat=$PAT_FOR_DEPLOY_KEY
vault kv put secret/aws access_key=$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID secret_key=$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

# Create EKS / ECR Admin policy (more privileged)
vault policy write eks-ecr-admin eks-ecr-admin.hcl

# Create EKS / ECR Admin role
vault write auth/approle/role/eks-ecr-admin token_policies="eks-ecr-admin"

# Get RoleID and SecretID for eks-ecr-admin role
vault read auth/approle/role/eks-ecr-admin/role-id
vault write -f auth/approle/role/eks-ecr-admin/secret-id

export ROLE_ID=role-id-from-above
export SECRET_ID=secret-id-from-above

#### Optional: Local test to see if we can read dynamic secrets using the AppRole token
vault write auth/approle/login role_id=$ROLE_ID secret_id=$SECRET_ID
# This creates a temporary federated token
# Read how to use here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html
VAULT_TOKEN=token vault write aws/sts/eks-ecr-admin ttl=30m
```

Now that your `ROLE_ID` and `SECRET_ID` are ready, it's time to add a self hosted runner. 

1. Create a [self hosted runner group for your organization](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-access-to-self-hosted-runners-using-groups#creating-a-self-hosted-runner-group-for-an-organization) called EKS / ECR Admin. I made it available to the `cakely/api-ops` repository.
1. Add a [self hosted runner to your organization](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/adding-self-hosted-runners#adding-a-self-hosted-runner-to-an-organization). As you go through the prompts of `config.sh`, be sure to add it to the EKS / ECR Admin runner group.
1. Start your self hosted runner with `./run.sh`. I used the very same Terminal tab as I exported `ROLE_ID` and `SECRET_ID` above.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Self Hosted Runner "ECR Push" (Less Privileged)

![ecr push](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2993937/90151984-4fdc0780-dd55-11ea-9b74-02e9724d803d.png)

<details><summary>Instructions</summary>

```bash
############### ECR Push ####################
# Enable AWS secrets engine
vault secrets enable -path=aws aws

# Configure AWS secrets engine with the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY 
# from `superuser-iam-policy.json` user
vault write aws/config/root \
    access_key=$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID \
    secret_key=$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY \
    region=my-region

# Create named Vault role with AWS IAM policy attached
vault write aws/roles/ecr-push \
    credential_type=federation_token \
    policy_document=@ecr-push-iam-policy.json

# Create ECR Push policy
vault policy write ecr-push ecr-push.hcl

# Create new ECR Push AppRole with ECR Push policy attached
vault write auth/approle/role/ecr-push token_policies="ecr-push"

# Get RoleID and SecretID for ecr-push role
vault read auth/approle/role/ecr-push/role-id
vault write -f auth/approle/role/ecr-push/secret-id

export ROLE_ID=role-id-from-above
export SECRET_ID=secret-id-from-above

#### Optional: Local test to see if we can read dynamic secrets using the AppRole token
vault write auth/approle/login role_id=$ROLE_ID secret_id=$SECRET_ID
# This creates a temporary federated token
# Read how to use here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html
VAULT_TOKEN=token vault write aws/sts/ecr-push ttl=30m
```

Now that your `ROLE_ID` and `SECRET_ID` are ready, it's time to add another self hosted runner. 

1. Create a [self hosted runner group for your organization](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-access-to-self-hosted-runners-using-groups#creating-a-self-hosted-runner-group-for-an-organization) called ECR Push. I made it available to the `cakely/api-ops` repository.
1. Add a [self hosted runner to your organization](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/adding-self-hosted-runners#adding-a-self-hosted-runner-to-an-organization). As you go through the prompts of `config.sh`, be sure to add it to the ECR Push runner group.
1. Start your self hosted runner with `./run.sh`. I used the very same Terminal tab as I exported `ROLE_ID` and `SECRET_ID` above.

## Future improvements

- Replace manual setup steps for self hosted runner with two container images
- Leverage the [AWS Secrets Engine](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/aws) in both cases.
